# OpenRefine Outreachy Internship Journey

Welcome to my OpenRefine Outreachy Internship Journey repository! This is the central hub where I'll be documenting and showcasing my design journey as an Outreachy intern with OpenRefine.

ðŸŽ¨ **Project Objective**: Improving how designers can contribute to OpenRefine

Throughout this internship, my goal is to enhance the collaboration between designers and developers, and create actionable workflows for meaningful design contributions to the OpenRefine project. Additionally, I will be developing a comprehensive design system library to facilitate consistent and efficient design implementation.

ðŸŒŸ **Key Deliverables**:
1. Actionable workflows for designers and developers seeking design assistance.
2. Design system library for OpenRefine's interface components and interaction patterns.

Join me on this exciting venture as we embark on the OpenRefine Design Contributions project. Together, we'll shape the future of OpenRefine's design, improve user experiences, and foster a more inclusive and collaborative design community.

Feel free to explore the repository, follow along with my progress, and provide feedback. Let's make OpenRefine more visually appealing, intuitive, and accessible!

ðŸš€ **Project Timeline**:
- **Week 1-2**: Project Kickoff and Planning
- **Weeks 3-4**: UI Analysis and Component Identification
- **Weeks 5-7**: Interactive Style Library Development
- **Weeks 8-9**: User Testing and Criteria for Evaluation
