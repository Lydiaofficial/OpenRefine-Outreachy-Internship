Hello and welcome back to my blog, where I'll be sharing my exciting journey as an Outreachy intern working 
on the OpenRefine project, “improve how designers can meaningfully contribute to OpenRefine” 

If you’re not new here, then you most definitely are familiar with my excitement about OpenRefine as I’ve 
written about it in my previous blog posts during the contribution phase of my Outreachy application. 

So you can understand that I'm absolutely buzzing to have this opportunity to contribute my UI/UX design 
skills to such an impactful project and software. So, grab a cup of your favorite beverage, and let’s do this!

Firstly let’s explore some of my core values:

Kindness: In a world that often feels chaotic, I believe that kindness can make a significant difference. Whether 
it's a small act of compassion or lending a listening ear, kindness has the power to create positive ripples
in our lives and those around us.

Curiosity: Curiosity has been my constant companion, propelling me to explore the wonders of the world. It has led 
me down exciting paths, from uncovering hidden corners of nature through sunset photography to diving into the 
depths of design possibilities. 

Humor: I love infusing humor into my interactions, projects, and everyday life. It adds a dash of lightheartedness
and reminds us not to lose sight of the joy that surrounds us. In this blog, expect witty anecdotes, funny 
design mishaps, and a sprinkle of laughter to brighten your day.

Beyond my love for design and technology, I have a few unique interests that shape my perspective and approach to 
problem-solving. For instance, I find solace in sad music, which, strangely enough, fuels my creativity. The 
emotions captured in those melodies inspire me to create meaningful and impactful designs.

Photography is another passion of mine, especially capturing breathtaking sunset moments. The beauty of nature 
reminds me of the importance of aesthetics in design and the power of creating experiences that evoke positive emotions.

Lastly, I love writing newsletters to my friends. This creative outlet not only allows me to communicate with my loved 
ones but also helps me practice concise storytelling, which is essential for effective UX design.


Last year, when I first learned about Outreachy,  I embarked on a journey to contribute to the Open Life Science project 
as an Outreachy applicant. Although I didn't make it past the contribution phase, that experience only fueled my 
determination to try again. The passion for design, combined with my desire to make a meaningful impact in open source, 
made me to apply for the Outreachy program once more, this time with OpenRefine and May the 4th, 2023 will go 
down as one the best days of my life.

I hope you stick around as I’m required to blog every 2 weeks on my journey. See yu soon.
